# Angarr UI

Special thanks to [Luxthos](https://www.luxthos.com/) for his WeakAuras packages for the classes I play.

Please consider using the [WeakAurasCompanion app](https://weakauras.wtf/) to get updates for my WeakAuras and others.

Please consider using [WowUp](https://wowup.io/) to update your addons regularly.

## Cool Features
* Filter Debuffs that appear on Player and Party Frames by opening /suf and going to Aura Filters > Manage Aura Filters > Blacklists > PlayerDebuffsBlocklist
