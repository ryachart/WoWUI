# Angarr UI
Preview (1/5/2021):
![](https://github.com/ryachart/WoWUI/blob/main/MistgarrUI.gif?raw=true)

## Description
Designed for 1920x1080 resolution, but similar aspect ratios and sizes should work fine after meddling with positions and anchors a bit.

Special thanks to [Luxthos](https://www.luxthos.com/) for his WeakAuras packages for the classes I play.

Please consider using the [WeakAurasCompanion app](https://weakauras.wtf/) to get updates for my WeakAuras and others.

Please consider using [WowUp](https://wowup.io/) to update your addons regularly.

## Helpful Tips
* Filter Debuffs that appear on Player and Party Frames by opening /suf and going to Aura Filters > Manage Aura Filters > Blacklists > PlayerDebuffsBlocklist

## Install Instructions
* In the top right of this page, click [Code] and then [Download Zip].  Extract the contents.
* Download and install [WowUp](https://wowup.io).
* Set aside your existing Interface/ and WTF/ Folder from your Retail WoW Directory. (Copy to Desktop is Fine)
* Copy the Interface/ and WTF/ Folders from the release into your Retail WoW Directory.
* Rename the ACCOUNT_NAME folder to your account name from your existing Retail WoW Directory (ex. MyAccountName)
* Rename the SERVER_NAME folder to the server name of your main character (ex. 'Tichondrius' for US-Tichondrius)
* Rename the CHARACTER_NAME folder to the character name of your main character.
* Go to Wowup and use it to update your addons.
* If possible, go the WeakAuras companion and download weak aura updates
* Login to your main character.  If it warns about out of date addons double check Wowup for updates and then click Load Anyway and then check the Addons loaded to make sure they are all loaded.
* After login, the chat window may be in your bottom left corner.  Right click on the General Tab after mousing over it to unlock it and move it to the top left.
* After login, you will need to type /sexymap and in the profile tab select "Use Global Profile" to use the Global Profile.
* IMPORTANT: If you are not a monk, mage, or shaman, I probably don't have a set of [Luxthos Weak Auras](https://www.luxthos.com/weakauras/general-weakauras-for-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands/) ready for you.  Go to this link and import them using /wa to open the Weak Auras menu once you're setup.
